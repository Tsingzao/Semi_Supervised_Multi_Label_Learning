This package needs the support of LibSVM,
readers are advised to add the mex files into '../util'.

1¡¢Download:
Average_precision.m coverage.m Hamming_loss.m One_error.m Ranking_loss.m and sample data.mat
from http://cse.seu.edu.cn/PersonalPage/zhangml/files/LIFT.rar 
Note the label/target should be binary (0 and 1).

2¡¢Download:
dist2.m and scale_dist.mexglx (need mex)
from http://lihi.eew.technion.ac.il/files/Demos/SelfTuning/ZPclustering.zip

3¡¢Add these seven files to '../util'

4¡¢Add 'sample data.mat' to '../Data'

5¡¢Run demo.m
